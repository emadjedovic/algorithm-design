/*
Radewoosh is a meteorologist. Thanks to his research station, he has learned the
predicted temperature for the next n days. The temperature for each day,
expressed in Bytenheit degrees, is always a positive integer.

He has decided to divide the next n days into k non-empty intervals so that
each day belongs to exactly one interval. Then, in the weather forecast,
Radewoosh will only provide k numbers - the arithmetic averages of the
temperatures from the days belonging to the respective intervals.

Make a division that maximizes the average temperature in the coldest of the
periods he provides (we call a period of days the coldest if none of the
remaining periods has a strictly lower average temperature).

Note: The days can be divided into periods as follows: [1,3,1],[2],[2,2,1].
The average temperature in the consecutive intervals will be 5/3, 2, and 5/3,
respectively, resulting in a minimum temperature of 5/3.
This division maximizes the minimum average temperature in a single period.
