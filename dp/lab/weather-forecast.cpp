We have temperature for the next n days (positive integers).
Divide those n days into k non-empty intervals so that
each day belongs to exactly one interval and the average temperature in the coldest of the periods is maximized (we call a period of days the coldest if none of the remaining periods has a strictly lower average temperature).
Then, output the average temperature in the coldest of the periods (the minimum of the maximized averages).

1.666666666667 (that is, 5/3)

Note: The days can be divided into periods as follows: [1,3,1],[2],[2,2,1].
The average temperature in the consecutive intervals will be 5/3, 2, and 5/3,
respectively, resulting in a minimum temperature of 5/3.
This division maximizes the minimum average temperature in a single period.
